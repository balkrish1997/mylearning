                <h4>RFID Security Access Control System</h4>
                <p>An RFID tag is used along with the reader to input the details of the employee/ student for tracking their attendance. When the RFID is swiped on the reader, the data of the tag is compared with data in the microcontroller (interfaced to the reader) to identify the user. An LCD is interfaced to the microcontroller to display the name of the user. Additionally, a status button is used to display the overall attendance of the user.</p>
                <p>Here an RFID tag is used which is indirectly connected to the RFID reader using the inductive coupling method. As the tag or the card is swiped against the reader, the tag receives a carrier signal from the reader and in turn modulates the carrier signal and sends it back. The reader receives this modulated signal and sends this data to the microcontroller. The microcontroller compares this data with the existing data and on pressing the status push button, the status of the cardholder is shown on the display, indicating the attendance of the cardholder.</p>
